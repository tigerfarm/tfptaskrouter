# Implement a Call Work Flow System

With Twilio Studio and TaskRouter, in less than two hours, you can set up a call flow, 
which is the bases of a caller-agent application system.
When a caller is added into the queue, TaskRouter creates a reservation and then asks an agent if they will accept the call.
The agent has the option to Accept, and be connected with the caller; or to Reject the call.
If the call is rejected, TaskRouter will ask the next available agent.

#### Call Work Flow

<img src="docFlowDiagram.jpg" width="600"/>

This exercise will walk you through the steps to configure your Twilio phone number to receive calls and put the callers into a queue.
The callers will listen to music while TaskRouter arranges an agent to take their call.

1. [Configure](README.md#configure-your-taskrouter-workspace) your Twilio TaskRouter Workspace.
2. [Create](README.md#create-an-ivr-studio-flow-to-manage-incoming-calls) an Studio IVR to welcome the caller and put them into the TaskRouter queue.
3. [Configure](README.md#configure-your-twilio-phone-number-to-use-the-studio-ivr) your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR.
4. [Implementation](README.md#local-computer-implementation) on your local computer.
5. [Work Application](README.md#taskrouter-worker-application-version-40) to manage their availability status.
6. [Test](README.md#test-the-call-work-flow-system) the call work flow system.

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OElX06i40Mg) for a video of me walking through the steps.
Note, the application in the video is an older PHP app, however it works basically the same as this NodeJS application.

Click [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api) for the Twilio TaskRouter REST API documentation.

#### Implementation requirements:
- You will need a [Twilio account](http://twilio.com/console). A free Trial account will work for testing.
- For testing, you will need at least 2 phone numbers; for example two mobile phone numbers: 
one to be the caller, the other phone number for the worker (agent).

These are the setup instructions which are located on this 
[tfptaskrouter](https://github.com/tigerfarm/tfptaskrouter/blob/master/README.md) GitHub repository.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure your TaskRouter Workspace

A task begins with a caller being entered into a Workspace's Workflow.
The Workflow puts the caller into a Task Queue which is a voice queue.
The Workflow finds a Worker to take the call that is in the queue.

A Worker can set their Activities availablity status.
A Worker has attributes to match them to one or more Task Queues.

Go to the [TaskRouter dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/dashboard):

Create a Workspace, and set:
- Name: writers.

Create a TaskQueue for callers, and set:
- TaskQueue Name to: support.
- Max Reserved Workers: 1.
- Queue expression: skills HAS "support".
- Note, workers that have support call skills("skills":["support"]) will be ask to take calls in this queue.

Create a Workflow, and set:
- Friendly Name: support.
- Assignment Callback, Task Reservation Timeout: 10. This gives the worker 10 seconds to accept the reservation before TaskRouter sets them to unavailable, and asks another worker to accept the call reservation.
- Default queue: support.

Create a Worker, and set:
- Name: charles.
- Attributes to: {"skills":["support"],"contact_uri":"+16505551111"}. Replace 16505551111, with your mobile phone number. This is the number that TaskRouter will use to call the worker.

View Your TaskRouter Activities:
- Offline, cannot be assigned a task
- Available(online) to be assign a task
- Unavailable, cannot be assigned a task

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create an IVR Studio Flow to Manage Incoming Calls

The Studio flow will welcome the call and then put them into the TaskRouter support Workflow.

Go to the Studio dashboard:
https://www.twilio.com/console/studio

Create a new flow, and set:
- Friendly name: Writers IVR.
- Use the default: Start from scratch.

Drag a "Gather Input On Call" widget onto the flow panel. This widget will welcome callers.
- Join Trigger Incoming Call to the Gather widget.
- Set the Text to Say to: "Welcome to Support. I will put you on hold while I find you an agent."
- Set "Stop gathering after" to 1 digit.

Drag an "Enqueue Call" widget onto the flow panel. 
This widget will put callers into the TaskRouter support Workflow.
The Workflow will put the caller into the support Task Queue.
- Join the Gather widget to the Enqueue Call widget.
- Set, TaskRouter Workspace, to: writers.
- Set, TaskRouter Workflow, to: support.

<img src="docStudioIvr.jpg" width="200"/>

Click Save. Click Publish. The Studio is complete and ready to use.

### Configure your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR

In the Twilio Console, [buy a phone number](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search), if you don't already have one:

In the phone numberâ€™s configuration page,
- Set Voice & Fax, A Call Comes In, to: Studio Flow / Writers IVR
- Click Save.

Test, by using your mobile phone to call your IVR Twilio phone number.
- You will hear your Say welcome message.
- You will be put into the TaskRouter queue and hear the wait music.
- Disconnect/hangup the call. Your IVR is successfully tested.

Check the queue has 1 caller (currentSize:1):
````
$ node voiceQueueList.js
++ Get voice queue list.
+  DateCreated:Sep 23 2020  SID:QU362afc106606164d74151aa4750a3160 currentSize:1    maxSize:100 friendlyName:WW1a2796889d5420ee5e715bf2ae460a99 averageWaitTime:106
````
Note, the friendlyName is the Workflow SID.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Local Computer Implementation

The application has a NodeJS HTTP webserver.

Download the [tfptaskrouter repository](https://github.com/tigerfarm/tfptaskrouter) zip file.

1. Click Clone or Download. Click Download ZIP.
2. Unzip the file into a work directory.
3. Change into the unzipped directory.

Install the NodeJS modules.
````
$ npm install twilio
$ npm install request
````
List of "require" modules used: twilio, request, express, path, and url.

Environement variables:
- TR_ACCOUNT_SID : your Twilio account SID (starts with "AC", available from Twilio Console)
- TR_AUTH_TOKEN : your Twilio account auth token (available from Twilio Console, click view)
- TR_TOKEN_PASSWORD : your token password (Password is required to create tokens. The password can be any string you want to use.)
- WORKSPACE_SID : your TaskRouter workspace SID

Run the NodeJS HTTP server.
````
$ node webserver.js 
+++ TaskRouter application web server is starting up.
+ ACCOUNT_SID   :ACakm3g5o8s9i6egrpakogpserkasglqe3:
+ WORKSPACE_SID :WS365319d72750ec7fc9bc8e5007c993ec:
+ Listening on port: 8000
+ Workspace friendlyName: writers
...
````
Note, CTRL + C to shutdown the webserver.

Use a browser to access the application:

http://localhost:8000/index.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TaskRouter Worker Application Version 4.0

This application is used by Twilio TaskRouter workers to 
manage their availability status, accept or reject reservation calls,
and end their reservation conference calls.

Functionality:
- Using their browser, the application allows workers to enter their identity and a password.
- Workers manage their status: available to take a call, busy while on a call, or unavailable.
- Status is displayed in the browser.
- Workers can accept or reject a call reservation.
- If a worker's reservation times out, the worker status is changed to unavailable.
- A worker can end a call which disconnects all participants from the reservation conference call.
- If a task is set to wrapping, it is automatically reset to completed. This avoids a worker not being able to reset their status.

Worker application screen print:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Test the Application

TaskRouter workers will use their web browser to manage their status: 
"offline" or "online" available to accept tasks.

Go to the TaskRouter worker website application
[link](http://localhost:8000/index.html).
````
The workspace activity options are listed in the Log messages:
...
> + ActivitySid_Offline = WA31703104b45cd069126e71c5de67a869
> + ActivitySid_Available = WA87258175ab8843ec6d75e54274eb456c
> + ActivitySid_Unavailable = WAd869170e0a0d27f9846c070b0edcaf79

I enter my identity: dave, and the application password, and click Get access token.
Logs:
> Refresh the TaskRouter token using client id: dave
> TaskRouter Worker token refreshed, stringlength :3088:
> registerTaskRouterCallbacks().
> TaskRouter token refreshed.
> Worker registered: dave.
> Skills: support
> Current activity is: Offline

I click Go online.

I check worker status and see that I'm (dave) is Available(online).
$ node workerStatus.js
+++ Start.

````

From the voice caller's side:
````
I make a voice call to my TaskRouter Twilio phone number.
The call is answered by the Studio flow IVR:
The Studio IVR messages is said (Say widget) and I'm put on hold in a TaskRouter workflow queue.
$ node tasksList.js
+++ List tasks and their reservations(if any).

````

Interactions:
````
Since the TaskRouter agent, "dave", is offered the option to Accept or Reject the task.
The workflow has a Task Reservation Timeout of 10 seconds. 
Dave does not click one of the option with 10 seconds, the reservation times out:
> reservation.created: You are reserved to handle a call from: +16505551111
> Reservation SID: WRc3d7d5e3ef968eda3038b67db775f0c5

The caller hangs up. The conference is still active, and other statuses are the same.
In the worker application, dave clicks End conference.
The conference is ended (set to status completed).
Worker(dave) activity updated to: Offline.
````

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your browser, go to your TaskRouter Workers Application.
- WorkSpace name is displayed: writers.
- Enter your worker name: charles.
- Enter your token password.
- Click Get access token. Worker status is displayed: Offline.
- Click Go online. Worker status is displayed: Available.
- Click Go offline, and Go online, which is how you set your availability status.
- Click Go online,to be available for a call reservation.

### Test the Call Work Flow System

Call your IVR Twilio phone number, and you will be put into the TaskRouter queue.
- In your TaskRouter Workers Application, Accept and Reject options are highlighted.
<img src="docTR_WorkerAr.jpg" width="300"/>

- Click Accept. When you accept a call, TaskRouter will dial your TaskRouter worker phone number("contact_uri").
- Your phone will ring, and, End conference will be highlighted because the call is a conference call.
- Answer your phone, and you are connected to the caller.
- Click End conference, and both you (the TaskRouter worker) and the caller are disconnected from the conference; the conference is ended.

You now have a working and tested TaskRouter implementation.

#### Next steps:
- Add more workers.
- Add a sales TaskRouter queue (skills HAS "sales") and Workflow.
- Add sales workers ({"skills":["sales"],"contact_uri":"+16505552222"}).
- Add sales as an IVR option in the Studio flow. This will require adding a Split widget and another Enqueue Call widget. Click [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio#get-started-with-twilio-studio) for a sample flow with a Split widget.
- Handle the case where no workers are available and the Workflow times out. Create and test a [Studio voicemail](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio/widget-library#record-voicemail) flow. Link it into your Workflow timeout option.
- Add business hours to your IVR. If a caller calls outside of the [business hours](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/06/custom-javascript-twilio-functions-code-studio-flows.html), put them straight into voicemail.
- Implement a Twilio Client so that agents can receive calls on their laptop. Click [here](https://github.com/tigerfarm/OwlClient) for my sample Twilio Client which has more features such as putting callers on hold.
