# Implement a Call Work Flow System

With Twilio Studio and TaskRouter, in less than two hours, you can set up a call flow, which is the bases of a call center. 

#### Call Work Flow

<img src="docFlowDiagram.jpg" width="600"/>

This exercise will walk you through the steps to configure your Twilio phone number to receive calls and put the callers into a queue.
The callers will listen to music while TaskRouter arranges an agent to take their call.

1. [Configure](README.md#configure-your-taskrouter-workspace) your Twilio TaskRouter Workspace.
2. [Create](README.md#create-an-ivr-studio-flow-to-manage-incoming-calls) an IVR, using Studio, to welcome the caller and put them into the TaskRouter queue.
3. [Configure](README.md#configure-your-twilio-phone-number-to-use-the-studio-flow) your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR.
4. [Deploy](README.md#deploy-the-taskrouter-worker-application) the TaskRouter Worker application and set the environment variables.
5. [Test](README.md#test-the-call-work-flow-system) the call work flow system.

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OElX06i40Mg) for a video of me walking through the steps.
Note, the application in the video is an older PHP app, however it works basically the same.

Click [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api) for a TaskRouter: REST API Reference.

#### Implementation requirements:
- You will need a [Twilio account](http://twilio.com/console). A free Trial account will work for testing.
- For testing, you will need at least 2 phone numbers; for example two mobile phone numbers: 
one to be the caller, the other phone number for the worker (agent).

The setup instructions are located at this GitHub repository URL:

https://github.com/tigerfarm/tfptaskrouter/blob/master/README.md

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure your TaskRouter Workspace

When a caller is added into the queue, TaskRouter creates a reservation and then asks an agent if they will accept the call.
The agent has the option to Accept, and be connected with the caller; or to Reject the call.
If the call is rejected, TaskRouter will ask the next available agent.

Go to the TaskRouter dashboard:
https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/dashboard 

Create a Workspace, and set:
- Name: writers.

Create a TaskQueue for callers, and set:
- TaskQueue Name to: support.
- Max Reserved Workers: 1.
- Queue expression: skills HAS "support". Workers with the skill to handle support calls ("skills":["support"]) will be ask to take calls in this queue.

Create a Workflow, and set:
- Friendly Name: support.
- Assignment Callback, Task Reservation Timeout: 10. This gives the worker 10 seconds to accept the reservation before TaskRouter sets them to unavailable, and asks another worker to accept the call reservation.
- Default queue: support. Note, I had to shrink the screen print to be able to see "support" as an option.

Create a Worker, and set:
- Name: charles.
- Attributes to: {"skills":["support"],"contact_uri":"+16505551111"}. Replace 16505551111, with your mobile phone number. This is the number that TaskRouter will use to call the worker.

View Your TaskRouter Activities: Offline, Available, and Unavailable

### Create an IVR Using Studio

The Studio flow will welcome the call and then put them incoming into the TaskRouter support queue.

Go to the TaskRouter dashboard:
https://www.twilio.com/console/studio

Create a new flow, and set:
- Friendly name: Writers IVR.
- Use the default: Start from scratch.

Drag a "Gather Input On Call" widget onto the flow panel. This widget will welcome callers.
- Join Trigger Incoming Call to the Gather widget.
- Set the Text to Say to: "Welcome to Support. I will put you on hold while I find you an agent."
- Set "Stop gathering after" to 1 digit.

Drag an "Enqueue Call" widget onto the flow panel. This widget will put callers into the TaskRouter support queue.
- Join the Gather widget to the Enqueue Call widget.
- Set, TaskRouter Workspace, to: writers.
- Set, TaskRouter Workflow, to: support.

Click Save. Click Publish. The Studio is complete and ready to use.

--- Or, if you are creating the Studio flow with your phone (drag and drop may not work), use the New Flow option: Import from JSON.
Copy and paste the following JSON, as your New Flow JSON Flow definition text.

### Configure your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR.

In the Twilio Console, buy a phone number, if you don't already have one:
https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search

In the phone numberâ€™s configuration page,
- Set Voice & Fax, A Call Comes In, to: Studio Flow / Writers IVR

Test, by using your mobile phone to call your IVR Twilio phone number.
- You will hear your Say welcome message.
- You will be put into the TaskRouter queue and hear the wait music.
- Disconnect/hangup the call. Your IVR is successfully tested.

#### Test the Application on Your Computer

Agents will use their web browser, on their computer, to manage their status: 
offline, or available to accept calls.

This application is ready to run from command line.

Add the following key value pairs:
- ACCOUNT_SID : your Twilio account SID (starts with "AC", available from Twilio Console)
- AUTH_TOKEN : your Twilio account auth token (Available from Twilio Console, click view)
- TOKEN_PASSWORD : your token password (Password is required to create tokens. The password can be any string you want to use.)
- WORKSPACE_SID : your TaskRouter workspace SID


From the TaskRouter worker's side, I go to the TaskRouter worker website application
[link](http://localhost:8000/tfptaskrouter/index.html).
````
The workspace activity options are listed in the Log messages:
...

> + ActivitySid_Available = WA87258175ab8843ec6d75e54274eb456c
> + ActivitySid_Unavailable = WAd869170e0a0d27f9846c070b0edcaf79

I enter my identity: dave, and the application password, and click Get access token.
Logs:
> Refresh the TaskRouter token using client id: dave
> TaskRouter Worker token refreshed, stringlength :3088:
> registerTaskRouterCallbacks().
> TaskRouter token refreshed.
> Worker registered: dave.
> Skills: support
> Current activity is: Offline

I click Go online.

I check worker status and see that I'm (dave) is Available(online).
$ node workerStatus.js
+++ Start.
++ List worker activity status.
+ WK1ab6ad88a07a856306c88ccaab3aa56a : edith : Offline
+ WKb9302b30213ee6a76c10cf8b4cf94612 : dave : Available
````

From the voice caller's side:
````
I make a voice call to my TaskRouter Twilio phone number.
The call is answered by the Studio flow IVR:
The Studio IVR messages is said (Say widget) and I'm put on hold in a TaskRouter workflow queue.
$ node tasksList.js
+++ List tasks and their reservations(if any).

+++ List tasks and their reservations(if any).
++ SID: WTa3ee1296c9f4bf072a9ed615371d5200 assignmentStatus: pending, Queue:support
````

Interactions:
````
Since the TaskRouter agent, "dave", is offered the option to Accept or Reject the task.
The workflow has a Task Reservation Timeout of 10 seconds. 
Dave does not click one of the option with 10 seconds, the reservation times out:
> reservation.created: You are reserved to handle a call from: +16505551111
> Reservation SID: WRc3d7d5e3ef968eda3038b67db775f0c5

> Reservation timed out: WRc3d7d5e3ef968eda3038b67db775f0c5
Dave is set to offline.

Dave goes back online, reservation is set to status: pending.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your browser, go to your TaskRouter Workers Application.
- WorkSpace name is displayed: writers.
- Enter your worker name: charles.
- Enter your token password.
- Click Get access token. Worker status is displayed: Offline.
- Click Go online. Worker status is displayed: Available.
- Click Go offline, and Go online, which is how you set your availability status.
- Click Go online,to be available for a call reservation.

### Test the Call Work Flow System

Call your IVR Twilio phone number, and you will be put into the TaskRouter queue.
- In your TaskRouter Workers Application, Accept and Reject options are highlighted.
<img src="docTR_WorkerAr.jpg" width="300"/>

- Click Accept. When you accept a call, TaskRouter will dial your TaskRouter worker phone number("contact_uri").
- Your phone will ring, and, End conference will be highlighted because the call is a conference call.
- Answer your phone, and you are connected to the caller.
- Click End conference, and both you (the TaskRouter worker) and the caller are disconnected from the conference; the conference is ended.

You now have a working and tested TaskRouter implementation.

#### Next steps:
- Add more workers.
- Add a sales TaskRouter queue (skills HAS "sales") and Workflow.
- Add sales workers ({"skills":["sales"],"contact_uri":"+16505552222"}).
- Add sales as an IVR option in the Studio flow. This will require adding a Split widget and another Enqueue Call widget. Click [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio#get-started-with-twilio-studio) for a sample flow with a Split widget.
- Handle the case where no workers are available and the Workflow times out. Create and test a [Studio voicemail](https://www.twilio.com/docs/studio/widget-library#record-voicemail) flow. Link it into your Workflow timeout option.
- Add business hours to your IVR. If a caller calls outside of the [business hours](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/06/custom-javascript-twilio-functions-code-studio-flows.html), put them straight into voicemail.
- Implement a Twilio Client so that agents can receive calls on their laptop. Click [here](https://github.com/tigerfarm/OwlClient) for my sample Twilio Client which has more features such as putting callers on hold.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## TaskRouter Worker Application Version 3.2

This application is used by Twilio TaskRouter workers to 
manage their availability status, accept or reject reservation calls,
and end their reservation conference calls.

## Functionality

- Using their browser, the application allows workers to enter their identity and a password.
- Workers manage their status: available to take a call, busy while on a call, or unavailable.
- Status is displayed in the browser.
- Workers can accept or reject a call reservation.
- If a worker's reservation times out, the worker status is changed to unavailable.
- A worker can end a call which disconnects all participants from the reservation conference call.
- If a task is set to wrapping, it is automatically reset to completed. This avoids a worker not being able to reset their status.
