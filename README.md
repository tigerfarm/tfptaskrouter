# Implement a Call Workflow Application

In less than two hours, you can use Twilio Studio and TaskRouter to implement a call flow application system.
This is the bases of a caller-agent application.

When someone calls your Twilio phone number, they'll hear an IVR welcome message
and get added into a workflow task queue.
They'll hear music wait while they wait for TaskRouter to find them an agent.
TaskRouter will prompt an agent with the option to Accept the call task.
If the agent rejects the task, TaskRouter will ask the next available agent.
If they Accept the call task, they are connected with the caller.

## Implementing the Call Work Flow System

Steps to configure a TaskRouter workspace,
setup a Studio IVR flow with a Twilio phone number,
implement and test the TaskRouter Worker website application:
1. [Configure](README.md#configure-your-taskrouter-workspace) your Twilio TaskRouter Workspace.
2. [Create](README.md#create-an-ivr-studio-flow-to-manage-incoming-calls) an Studio IVR to welcome the caller and put them into the TaskRouter workflow queue.
3. [Configure](README.md#configure-your-twilio-phone-number-to-use-the-studio-ivr-flow) your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR.
4. [Implementation](README.md#local-computer-implementation) on your local computer.
5. [Test](README.md#test-the-application) the call work flow application system.

Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OElX06i40Mg) for a video of me walking through the steps.
Note, the application in the video is an older PHP app, however it works basically the same as this NodeJS application.

#### Implementation requirements:
- You will need a [Twilio account](http://twilio.com/console). A free Trial account will work for testing.
- For testing, you will need at least 2 phone numbers: 
one to be the caller, and the other for the worker (agent).

These are the setup instructions which are located on this 
[tfptaskrouter](https://github.com/tigerfarm/tfptaskrouter/blob/master/README.md) GitHub repository.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure your TaskRouter Workspace

A task begins with a caller being added into a workspace's workflow.
The workflow puts the caller into a task queue which is a voice queue.
The workflow finds a worker to take the call that is in the queue.

A worker can set their activity availablity status.
A worker has attributes to match them to one or more task queues.

Go to the [TaskRouter dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console/taskrouter/dashboard):

Create a Workspace, and set:
- Name: writers.

Create a Task Queue for callers, and set:
- Task Queue Name to: Support.
- Set "Reservation Activity" and "Assignment Activity" to Offline.
- Max Reserved Workers: 1.
- Queue expression: skills HAS "support".
- Note, workers that have support call skills: "skills":["support"], will be asked to take calls in this queue.

Create a Workflow, and set:
- Friendly Name: Support.
- Assignment Callback, Task Reservation Timeout: 10. This gives the worker 10 seconds to accept the reservation before TaskRouter sets them to unavailable, and asks another worker to accept the call reservation. Note, this value can be overridden in the web application.
- Default queue: Support.

Create a Worker, and set:
- Worker name: dave.
- Attributes to: {"name":"dave","skills":["support"],"contact_uri":"+16505551111"}.
- Replace 16505551111, with your mobile phone number. This is the number that TaskRouter will use to call you, the worker.
- Attribute "name", is used [retrieve a worker's SID](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api/worker?code-sample=code-list-workers-with-target-expression&code-language=Node.js&code-sdk-version=4.x).
Attribute "name" value needs to match the "Worker name" value.

View your Worker Activities options:
- Offline, cannot be assigned a task
- Available(online) to be assign a task
- Unavailable, the worker is working on a task

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create an IVR Studio Flow to Manage Incoming Calls

The Studio flow will welcome the caller and then put them into the TaskRouter support workflow.

Go to the Studio dashboard:
https://www.twilio.com/console/studio

Create a new flow, and set:
- Friendly name: Writers IVR.
- Use the default: Start from scratch.

Drag a "Gather Input On Call" widget onto the flow panel, to welcome callers.
- Join Trigger Incoming Call to the Gather widget.
- Set the Text to Say to: "Welcome to Support. I will put you on hold while I find you an agent."
- Set "Stop gathering after" to 1 digit to allow the caller to quickly put themself into the queue.

Drag an "Enqueue Call" widget onto the flow panel, to put callers into the TaskRouter support workflow.
The workflow will put the caller into the support task queue.
- Join the Gather widget to the Enqueue Call widget.
- Set, TaskRouter Workspace, to: writers.
- Set, TaskRouter Workflow, to: support.

<img src="docStudioIvr.jpg" width="200"/>

Click Save. Click Publish. The Studio flow is complete and ready to use.

### Configure your Twilio phone number to use the Studio IVR Flow

In the Twilio Console, if you don't already have a Twilio phone number,
[buy a phone number](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search).

In the phone numberâ€™s configuration page,
- Set Voice & Fax, A Call Comes In, to: Studio Flow / Writers IVR
- Click Save.

Test, by using your mobile phone to call your IVR Twilio phone number.
- You will hear the Gather widget welcome message.
- You will be put into the TaskRouter queue(a voice queue) and hear the wait music.
Check that the queue has 1 caller (currentSize:1):
````
$ node voiceQueueList.js
++ Get voice queue list.
+  DateCreated:Sep 23 2020  SID:QU362afc106606164d74151aa4750a3160 currentSize:1    maxSize:100 friendlyName:WW1a2796889d5420ee5e715bf2ae460a99 averageWaitTime:106
````
Note, the friendlyName is the workflow SID.
- Disconnect/hangup the call. Your IVR is successfully tested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Local Computer Implementation

The application has a NodeJS HTTP webserver which makes Twilio TaskRouter REST API requests.
Click [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api) for the TaskRouter API documentation.

Download the [tfptaskrouter repository](https://github.com/tigerfarm/tfptaskrouter) zip file.

1. Click Clone or Download. Click Download ZIP.
2. Unzip the file into a work directory.
3. Change into the unzipped directory.

Install the NodeJS modules.
````
$ npm install twilio
$ npm install request
````
List of "require" modules used: twilio, request, express, path, and url.

Environement variables:
- TR_ACCOUNT_SID : your Twilio account SID (starts with "AC", available from Twilio Console)
- TR_AUTH_TOKEN : your Twilio account auth token (available from Twilio Console, click view)
- TR_TOKEN_PASSWORD : application password that is used by a worker to receive an access tokens.
- WORKSPACE_SID : your TaskRouter workspace SID

Run the NodeJS HTTP server.
````
$ node webserver.js 
+++ TaskRouter application web server is starting up.
+ ACCOUNT_SID   :ACakm3g5o8s9i6egrpakogpserkasglqe3:
+ WORKSPACE_SID :WS365319d72750ec7fc9bc8e5007c993ec:
+ Listening on port: 8000
+ Workspace friendlyName: writers
...
````
Note, CTRL + c to shutdown the webserver.

Use a browser to access the application: http://localhost:8000/index.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Test the Application

TaskRouter workers will use their web browser to manage their status: 
"offline" or "online" available to accept tasks.

Go to the TaskRouter worker website application
[link](http://localhost:8000/index.html).

In your browser, go to your TaskRouter Workers Application.
- WorkSpace name is displayed: writers.
- Enter your worker name: dave.
- Enter your token password.
- Click Get access token. Worker status is displayed: Offline.
- Click Go online. Worker status is displayed: Available.
- Click Go offline, and Go online, which is how you set your availability status.
- Click Go online,to be available for a call reservation.

<img src="docTR_WorkerOnline.jpg" width="300"/>

When the worker first connects to the application, 
the workspace activity options are listed in the Log messages:
````
...
> + ActivitySid_Offline = WA31703104b45cd069126e71c5de67a869
> + ActivitySid_Available = WA87258175ab8843ec6d75e54274eb456c
> + ActivitySid_Unavailable = WAd869170e0a0d27f9846c070b0edcaf79

I enter my identity: dave, and the application password.
Click Get access token.
Logs:
> Refresh the TaskRouter token using client id: dave
> TaskRouter Worker token refreshed, stringlength :3088:
> registerTaskRouterCallbacks().
> TaskRouter token refreshed.
> Worker registered: dave.
> Skills: support
> Current activity is: Offline

I have a TaskRouter worker token.
Click Go online.
I check worker status and see that I'm (dave) Available(online).
$ node workerStatus.js

From the voice caller's side:
````
I make a voice call to my TaskRouter Twilio phone number.
The call is answered by the Studio flow IVR.

The Studio IVR Gather widget says a welcome messages,
then I'm put on hold in a TaskRouter workflow queue:
$ node voiceQueueList.js
++ Get voice queue list.
